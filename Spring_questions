# Using int Instead Of String: 
public static void main (int[] args) : at starting jvm only accept String[]. If try than give - "please define the main method as: public static void main(String[] args)”

Alternative we can define another main :

public class IntArgsTest { 
public static void main(int[] args) { IntArgsTest iat = new IntArgsTest(args); } 
public IntArgsTest(int[] n) { System.out.println(n[0]); }; 

public static void main(String[] args) { int[] intArgs = new int[args.length]; for (int i : intArgs) { try { intArgs[i] = Integer.parseInt(args[i]); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { System.err.println("Failed trying to parse a non-numeric argument, " + args[i]); } } main(intArgs); } }

# Can a constructor be made final, abstract in Java? 
No, a constructor can’t be made final. A final method cannot be overridden by any subclasses.
# Can a constructor be made private in Java? 
Yes, to prevent use in subclass, can’t create instant from outsider class, use in design singleton pattern. 
# Type of polymorphism :
Overloading : method name will same but params will differ, if there is any mistake it’s give run time error.
Overriding : method signature, name, parameter will same, it can be overwritten. Give compile time error.   

# Loose coupling :

 In simple words, loose coupling means they are mostly independent. If the only knowledge that class A has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and class B are said to be loosely coupled. ... The examples of Loose coupling are Interface,DI

# Difference between Inversion of Control & Dependency Injection

These are patterns to achieve loose coupling in java programming

DI(Dependency Injection):
Dependency injection is a pattern used to create instances of objects that other objects rely upon without knowing at compile time which class will be used to provide that functionality or simply the way of injecting properties to an object is called dependency injection.

We have three types of Dependency injection

Constructor Injection
Setter/Getter Injection
Interface Injection
Spring will support only Constructor Injection and Setter/Getter Injection.

IOC(Inversion Of Control):
Giving control to the container to create and inject instances of objects that your application depend upon, means instead of you are creating an object using the new operator, let the container do that for you. Inversion of control relies on dependency injection because a mechanism is needed in order to activate the components providing the specific functionality

The two concepts work together in this way to allow for much more flexible, reusable, and encapsulated code to be written. As such, they are important concepts in designing object-oriented solutions.

Example for Dependency injection

Previously we are writing code like this

Public MyClass{
 DependentClass dependentObject
 /*
  At somewhere in our code we need to instantiate 
  the object with new operator  inorder to use it or perform some method.
  */ 
  dependentObject= new DependentClass();
  dependentObject.someMethod();
}
With Dependency injection, the dependency injector will take off the instantiation for us

Public MyClass{
 /* Dependency injector will instantiate object*/
 DependentClass dependentObject

 /*
  At somewhere in our code we perform some method. 
  The process of  instantiation will be handled by the dependency injector
 */ 

  dependentObject.someMethod();
}
The above process of giving the control to some other (for example the container) for the instantiation and injection can be termed as Inversion of Control

You can read more on dependency injection and IOC in my answer :- You can find advantages and applications of the concepts here.

# Can you give few examples of Dependency Injection?
dependentObject= new DependentClass();
  dependentObject.someMethod();

# put vs post vs patch method
put use for update info fully
Patch use for update only one field
Post use for create new info

# What is Auto Wiring? 
Kind fo DI to use another class element


# What are the important roles of an IOC Container?
Initiate dependency obj for use using new key words

# Context
Is just environment, scope where var method exit, can access by this keyword. 

# What are Bean Factory and Application Context?
Can you compare Bean Factory with Application Context?

BeanFactory and ApplicationContext both are Java interfaces and ApplicationContext extends BeanFactory. Both of them are configuration using XML configuration files. In short BeanFactory provides basic Inversion of control(IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) features while ApplicationContext provides advanced features.

# get nth salary
## for all db
SELECT name, salary from #Employee_table e1 WHERE n-1 = ( SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT salary FROM #Employee_table e2 WHERE e2.salary < e1.salary ))
## for mysql
SELECT salary from tbl_name ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT BY n-1, 1

# What’s the difference Between @Controller, @Component, @Repository, @SpringBootApplication and @Service Annotations in Spring?
@component : use in bean, model for easy to use, using @Autowire.
@controller : behave as a logic controller build for normal html, js whether @RestController by default return xml/json response.
@Repository : use with JPA interface for gather info form db, a persistence layer of connection 
@service :  a persistence layer of service 
@SpringBootApplication : 
@Configuration to enable Java-based configuration
@ComponentScan to enable component scanning.
@EnableAutoConfiguration to enable Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature.

# how HashMap works internally
hashMap based on node


node
key
value
next()


There are three method available
equals(): compare key if found then replace otherwise replace
hashcode() : return a reference/address/Integer where element is inserted.
buckets(): node of array.

Steps for insertion/replacement:
Get index by using formula = hashcodeKey && (n-1)
Use an equal method for compare key and index if not found insert otherwise replace. 
If index is same but key is different than map with internal key

Steps for retrieve data:
Get the index, if key found in that index return value
In index, value is not found then search for next(use next fn) and return value.
